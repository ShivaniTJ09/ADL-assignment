# Axioms

Axioms are included to specify that a part cannot include another part, that a whole object cannot include another whole object, and that each whole is generally associated with a set of given parts.
A grounded theory that considers also mereological constraints as prior knowledge can be constructed by adding such axioms to

Here they have used the Mutual exclusion axiom. we can desribe mutual exclusion is a property of concurrency control, which is instituted for the purpose of preventing race conditions.
