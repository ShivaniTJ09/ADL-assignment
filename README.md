# Axioms

Axioms are included to specify that a part cannot include another part, that a whole object cannot include another whole object, and that each whole is generally associated with a set of given parts.
A grounded theory that considers also mereological constraints as prior knowledge can be constructed by adding such axioms to

defined this more formally

1) The first containing only training examples of object types and partof relations (𝑇𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑙)

* Mutual exclusion constraints

Here they have used the Mutual exclusion axiom. we can desribe mutual exclusion is a property of concurrency control, which is instituted for the purpose of preventing race conditions.it can be described into K(K − 1))/2 clauses, corresponding to all unordered class pairs over K classes, e.g., Cat(x) ⇒ ¬Person(x)

The second containing also logical axioms about types and part-of (𝑇𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟)

* Mererological Constraints

this indicate that if an object y is classified as part of x and x is a cat, thany can be only an object that we know is a part of the whole cat. Mereological constraints were enforced exploiting the KB developement, to which the reader is referred for further information.
